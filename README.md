# Rank-based Gene Pair Analysis (rGPA)
This program implements the original RankComp and the RankCompV2 algorithms to detect the dysregulated genes. It is applicable to gene expression, methylation and other gene microarray data sets. Both large-scale cohort and individual samples or small-scale cell-line samples with two or three technical replicates can be analyzed. 

If you publish results from using this progam, please cite the following paper.

## Algorithm

### Significally Stable Gene Pairs
A pair of genes, {*a*, *b*}, is considered as statistically stable if they hold the same order relationship (*a* < *b* or *a* >*b*) in most of the samples. Binomial distribution is used to calculate the *P* value under the null hypothesis (a and b does not have a stable order relation) for the large-scale samples. The [Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate) is used to control the false discovery rate (FDR) at level alpha, which is 0.05 by default. For small-scale samples, such as technial replicates in the cell-line studies, the exception number is used to screen the stable pairs. For example, if the exception number is set as 0, the pair holds the same order relation in all the samples. 

*Note on Notation Abuse*: *a*, *b* are used to represent both genes and the expression values (or methylation level etc) of the genes. Readers should be able to discern what the notations represent with no trouble. 

### Concordant and Reversal Gene Pairs
If a pair of genes, {*a*, *b*}, is significanlly stable in both the normal group and the disease group and the orders are the same (either *a* < *b* or *a* > *b*), the pair is a concordant pair. Likewise, if a pair is stable in both groups, but the orders are different (*a* < *b* in one group, but *a* > *b* in the other group), the pair is called reversal pair.  Concordant and reveral gene pairs are the basic data to detect dysregulated genes.   


### Dysregulated Genes, the Original RankComp Algorithm
Whether a gene is dysregulated or not in a disease cohort compared with normal cohort is identified through the original RankComp algorithm or through the improved RankCompV2 algorithm. Here is a breif description on the algorithms. Interested users are advised to read the related papers.

For one gene, *a*, we count the numbers of genes whose expression (or methylation etc) levels are higher and lower than this gene in the normal cohort and in the disease cohort. The counting is carried out for the concordant and reveral gene pairs only. Thus, we obtain the following contigency table.


 | the number of genes whose expression levels are higher than *a* | the number of genes whose expression levels are less than *a* 
------------ | -------------
Normal | ng | nl
Disease | dg | dl
